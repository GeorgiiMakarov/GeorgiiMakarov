## 👋 Hi, I’m Georgii Makarov

I'm a **Web4 systems architect** and builder of **next-gen digital experiences** that integrate spatial computing, tokenized economies, and intelligent automation.

### 🚀 Current Focus Areas

#### 🌐 1. Web4 Platform Ecosystem
A modular architecture for **interoperable digital layers** — blending MR/AR, AI assistants, and spatial data APIs.  
Includes:
- **Volumetric Scene API** (3D asset processing & delivery)
- **Realtime mission/kvest framework** powered by media IPs
- **MR-environment orchestration SDK** (React Three Fiber & Unity integrations)

#### 🏆 2. Activity-based Token Economy
Rewarding physical and cognitive activity (walks, workouts, hobbies) via smart wearables + blockchain integration.  
Features:
- Crypto incentives in **Digital Tenge** and stablecoins
- Biometric sync from smart devices (Fitbit, Apple Watch, etc.)
- Fraud-proofing using AI behavioral patterns

#### 💱 3. Digital Tenge Integration Layer
Secure bridge between **national CBDC (Digital Tenge)** and user-level applications.  
Enables:
- Fast crypto ↔ fiat conversion
- Smart wallet orchestration (in compliance with local law)
- Micropayments for activity rewards, quests, and subscriptions

#### 🎮 4. MR/AR + IP-Driven Story Worlds
Immersive missions and spatial content, built on top of popular IPs (films, games).  
Tooling:
- Scene-to-scene navigation with custom logic
- Real-world interaction mapped via device sensors
- SDK-ready MR packages for Meta / Apple headsets

#### 5. Spatial Data & AI Integration
Automated systems for parsing, analyzing, and adapting **3D environments**:
- Point cloud processing (.splat, .glb, .gltf)
- Asynchronous AI pipelines for media analysis
- Generative MR layering with live inference

### 🧭 Philosophy

> I don't just build apps — I **compose systems** that bridge physical, digital, and cognitive realms.
